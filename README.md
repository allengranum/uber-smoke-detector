# uber-smoke-detector
Arduino sketch for ESP8266 Huzzah based smoke detector environment monitor

This sketch requires the iot library to be manually integrated into the
Arduino IDE for linking to succeed. This library is built separately
using avr-gcc to create a pubsub based iot interface API which can talk
to the Wind River HDC gateway.
